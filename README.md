# Course info for me [begin]
## Learning goals
- _You understand the difference between client side and server side rendering and you can apply server side rendering_
in your application_
- _You understand how a Service Worker works and you can implement it in your application._
- _You understand how the critical render path works and how you can optimize it for a better runtime and / or perceived performance._

## :rocket: Purpose of Project
In this course I will convert the client side web application previously made Web App From Scratch into a server side rendered application. I also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately I'm going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application. All the basic parts covered in this course are very useful to know when you later choose to make an app using a framework. All these parts are (almost) all automated in a framework and are therefore done for you. So it is helpful to know exactly how those parts work.

- atomic design (wk1)

### Plan van Aanpak
1. Copy the WAFS app in this repo :white_check_mark:
2. Delete the unnecessary features :white_check_mark:
3. Install npm, Node.js and Express :white_check_mark:
4. Refactor the code to a server side version (with Nodejs & Express) 
5. Check if the application works

## :heart_eyes: Concept
This application is a _rebuild_ from the [**CAT**CH YOUR LAUGH-application](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH). Here I focus on the client- and serverside rendering and am I able to create a **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp.

**CAT**CH YOUR LAUGH is an application where you can amuse pictures of cats in combination with jokes :cat: :laughing: . You can use this app when the atmosphere is no longer good, or there is no discussion material for a while, or you just want to laugh hard. Then this is the solution! This combination will lead to endless laughter from the user! 

You may *like* the combination of the cat and the joke. It will be saved on the 'My Favourites' page and there you will see all your favourite combinations. You can also click on one of your favourites and you will be taken to the detail page where you will see your favourite in large format.

### [Live version here :red_circle:](https://ralfz123.github.io/progressive-web-apps-2021)


#### Features
- By clicking on the 'ANOTHER COMBO' button you can see a different combination of a cat image and a joke

    }
]
```

#### 2. Jokes
```js
{
    id: 327,
    type: "general",
    setup: "Why did Sweden start painting barcodes on the sides of their battleships?",
    punchline: "So they could Scandinavian."
}
```
