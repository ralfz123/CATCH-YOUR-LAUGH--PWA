## :rocket: Purpose of Project
In this course I will convert the client side web application previously made Web App From Scratch into a server side rendered application. I also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately I'm going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application. All the basic parts covered in this course are very useful to know when you later choose to make an app using a framework. All these parts are (almost) all automated in a framework and are therefore done for you. So it is helpful to know exactly how those parts work.

## :heart_eyes: Concept
This application is a _rebuild_ from the [**CAT**CH YOUR LAUGH](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH)-application. Here I focus on the client- and serverside rendering and am I able to create a **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp.

#### Features
- By clicking on the 'ANOTHER COMBO' button you can see a different combination of a cat image and a joke
- Like your favourite combination of a cat image and a joke
- Create a favourites list with your favourite combinations of a cat image and a joke

To get more information about the app, for example it's APIs, check it [here](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH/blob/master/README.md#heart_eyes-concept).

## :nerd_face: Technical summary
This is a Progressive Web App (PWA). A number of characteristics are:
- It has an app-like interface, through the [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/blob/master/src/assets/manifest.json). In the browser the app is 'installable'. Which means you can add the app to your homescreen and when you launch the app, you have an app-like interface and the default browser interface is disappeared.
- Offline work mode - caching manager [`service-worker.js`](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/blob/master/src/assets/service-worker.js)

This Progressive Web App is built, using:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Node.js server](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express router](https://expressjs.com/)
- [EJS Templating engine](https://ejs.co/)
- [Gulp tooling](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Heroku deployment](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs)

## :hammer_and_pick: Build
#### Server 
For running the server I use the Express framework for Node.js. This is a web framework for Node.js which is good for setting up a server.

1. Require Express
```
const express = require("express");
```

After that you init your app
```
const app = express();
```

Config your Express-app
```js
 // Declare your static folder
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Run the server on a port
app.listen(5000, () => console.log(`App is running on port 5000`));
```

#### Templating engine
For the templating engine I use EJS. I really like EJS, because it is easy to implement and work with.

An example of how I render a page and pass data with rendering

```js
app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
   // Get data through fetch and put in a variable called dataAll
  const dataAll = await getData();

  // Declare data variables for better use in .ejs files
  const catData = dataAll.filteredDataCat;
  const jokeData = dataAll.filteredDataJokes;

  // Render data
  res.render('index.ejs', { catData, jokeData });
});
```

In the `.ejs` file
```html
<img src="<%= catData.url %>" alt="">
<label id="joke" for="joke"><%= jokeData.setup %></label>
<label id="punchline" for="punchline"><%= jokeData.punchline %></label>
```

### Building
For the building I use Gulp. It was for me the first time I used a bundler/tooling. At the beginning I struggled a lot with building/minifying my code, because I didn't get it. But now I understand what tooling is. Tooling is a feature for the developer to smart and fast build your application. As npm script I used a nice script: `"dev": "build && nodemon start"`. This a script I used a lot during development. It means that the app firstly is building and secondly it starts the nodemon server. For building the app before deploying, I used `npm run build` and then it first empties the folders in `/public` and then the files were build (minified). Here are my npm scripts in the [package.json](https://github.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/blob/master/package.json).

```json
"start": "node app.js",
"dev": "build && nodemon start",
"build": "npm-run-all build:*",
"prebuild:css": "rimraf \"public/css\"",
"build:css": "npm run prebuild:css && node buildscripts/build-css.js",
"prebuild:js": "rimraf \"public/js\"",
"build:js": "npm run prebuild:js && node buildscripts/build-js.js",
"prebuild:assets": "rimraf \"public/assets\"",
"build:assets": "npm run prebuild:assets && node buildscripts/build-assets.js",
"prebuild:icons": "rimraf \"public/icons\"",
"build:icons": "npm run prebuild:icons && node buildscripts/build-icons.js",
"deploy": "git push && git push heroku master"
```

#### Build CSS
```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const cleanCSS = require('gulp-clean-css');

return gulp
  .src('./static/styles/main.css')
  .pipe(cleanCSS())
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));

```

#### Build JS
```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const concat = require('gulp-concat');

return gulp
  .src('./static/scripts/*.js')
  .pipe(concat('bundle.min.js'))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/js'));

```

#### Build assets
```js
const gulp = require('gulp');

return gulp
    .src('./static/assets/*')
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/assets'));

```

#### Build icons
```js
const gulp = require('gulp');

return gulp
    .src('./static/icons/*')
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/icons/'));

```

### Deploying
To deploy my application I used Heroku for the first time. It's easy to use, but my deployment had some issues with don't `GET` the `path` and the `favicon`. Now that issue is fixed to replace the `PORT` in my `app.js` with `process.env.PORT || 5000`. Here is a roadmap of deploying your application to Heroku via git command Heroku CLI.

```
1. heroku create // Create heroku CLI
2. git add . && git commit -m 'Update app' // Add your last changes and commit
3. git push heroku master // Push to heroku master branch
4. catch-your-laugh.herokuapp.com // Build is done and deployed
```

### Critical Render Path

#### Lighthouse test

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/master/readme/performance-26-3.png" width=600px />

**First Contentful Paint - 0,9 s**
First Contentful Paint (FCP) is when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading. The question "Is it happening?" is "yes" when the first contentful paint completes.

**Speed Index - 0,9 s**
Speed Index measures how quickly content is visually displayed during page load. Lighthouse first captures a video of the page loading in the browser and computes the visual progression between frames.

**Largest Contentful Paint - 1,5 s**
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a Core Web Vitals metric and measures when the largest content element in the viewport becomes visible. It can be used to determine when the main content of the page has finished rendering on the screen.

**Time to Interactive - 1,5 s**
TTI measures how long it takes a page to become fully interactive. A page is considered fully interactive when the page displays useful content, which is measured by the First Contentful Paint, and event handlers are registered for most visible page elements.

**Total Blocking Time - 0 ms**
The Total Blocking Time (TBT) metric measures the total amount of time between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.

**Cumulative Layout Shift - 0,001**
CLS measures the sum total of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page.


### Optimisations

#### Using local fonts
First I was fetching the custom fonts from an API (Google Fonts), but that costs too much. Therefore I choose to use local fonts to reduce the size of the fetched style sheets plus the application does not have to download anything from the internet again. For this optimisation I used [Google Webfonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) to serve the fonts locally.

After that have done, the performance is improved by 1 point -_- .
#### Building files
Unfortunately I don't have a screenshot of the difference between before and after implementing the building files.
I raised at least .5 seconds faster.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/master/readme/perform-best-prac-26-3.png" width=400px />

#### Added robots.txt + sitemap.xml
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/master/readme/seo-optimisations.png" width=400px />

Added robots.txt and sitemap.xml, because of SEO. Although it was 100%, it can also be improved ;) . The 2 files add content and intelligence to the application, so a search engine like Google can find better your website.

### PWA

<details>
<summary>Before</summary>
Because the manifest don't loaded correctly, it wasn't installable. I had to take a look at this, because the service worker didn't work at that moment, the manifest cannot be read.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ralfz123/CATCH-YOUR-LAUGH--PWA/master/readme/pwa-26-3.png" style="display:block;" width=400px />
</details>


<details>
<summary>After</summary>
Now the manifest.json and service-worker works correctly. So now the pwa statistics are much better üî• . But there are some things I don't understand:

It says "Is not configured for a custom splash screen. Failures: Manifest does not have `background_color`." I don't like and understand this, because I do have a background_color in the manifest. So this is very weird.

<img src="readme/pwa-30-3.png" width=500px />

</details>

### Things I cannot fix
Some statistics are things I cannot fix, because I don't have the rights to change them. Like this issue below, it lays on the server.

## Job story
### Service-worker 
> _Because of having not enough time and my application crashed a lot of times, I deciced to only serve an offline page while the user is offline._

At the moment I want to add a new favourite, it is added to a global array. But at the moment when the list where the page lives is `/favourites`. When the app starts (and during the app), this page **must not** be added to the cache. Because when you hit the like button to create a new fav combo and you want to see the fav list, you click on MY FAVOURITES and go to `/favourites`. The service worker takes then this page from the cache and you see an empty fav list. Therefore you need to whitelist `/favourites` so this page won't be cached, but retrieved from the server. But on the other side I want to see my fav list when I am offline.

All pages will be cached, excluded the /favourites. All pages will be served from the server when online. While the user is offline, then the pages will be shown whose are cached when the user was online. The pages whose are not cached and when the user wants to enter them, he receives an offline page.

## Challenges / Inventions:
Learned:  
- Module.exports in Node.js
- Application tab in Chrome Inspector
- Service worker
- What is caching
- Manifest.json
- PWA statistics and performance info (helper to improve)
